# When developing Wagtail templates, we recommend django-debug-toolbar
# for keeping track of page rendering times. To use it:
#     pip install django-debug-toolbar==1.0.1
# and uncomment the lines below.

# from .base import INSTALLED_APPS, MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES
# INSTALLED_APPS += (
#     'debug_toolbar',
# )
# MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES += (
#     'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware',
# )
# # django-debug-toolbar settings
# DEBUG_TOOLBAR_CONFIG = {
#     'INTERCEPT_REDIRECTS': False,

# If you're developing Wagtail itself (as opposed to building a Wagtail-powered site), you'll
# want to tweak the Python path so that it picks up your working copy of the Wagtail code
# rather than the packaged copy - uncomment the lines below to do that.
# Here we assume that you have it in a 'wagtail' directory at the same level as your
# 'wagtaildemo' checkout - adjust the path as appropriate.

# import sys
# import os
# PATH_TO_WAGTAIL = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', '..', '..', 'wagtail')
# sys.path.insert(1, PATH_TO_WAGTAIL)
